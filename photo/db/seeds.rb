# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   Users = User.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", User: Users.first)
# User.destroy_all

# 100.times do |index|
#   User.create!(title: Faker::Lorem.sentence(word_,
#                 director: Faker::Name.name,
#                 storyline: Faker::Lorem.paragraph,
#                 watched_on: Faker::Time.between(from: 4.months.ago, to: 1.week.ago))
